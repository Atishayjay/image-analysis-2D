# Analysis of simple 2D images

This project aims to quantify the number of objects present in an image file. The test algorithm uses Otsu's thresholding method to find descrete objects such as blobs. 

# Purpose of the project

The main purpose of this project was to help me understand the basics of 2D image analysis so that I could analyse 3D images generated from confocal microscopy.

## Usage

Once you have pulled the code from this repository, upload the 2D image that you want to analyse into the same file location of the code. Simply change the name of the image file in line #6 and run the code.

## Output

After processing, a window will open with a grey-scale image. This will help the user visualize the counting step. Closing the pop-up window will reveal the object count and coverage (as a percentage) in the IDE or Command-line window.
